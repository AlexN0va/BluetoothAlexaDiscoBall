# Bluetooth Alexa Disco Ball

## have you ever wanted to have a disco party on command? 

This simple project gives you opportunity to do that with two main components 
  1. ESP-32
  2. Amazon Alexa
 

This project is straightforward and easy to follow. I commenced the project by creating a 3D model in which to encapsulate the electrical components. (I was also eager to utilize OnShape and create some 3D models.) The 3D model is elementary, with limited features; however, additional features can be incorporated, such as a mechanism that enables the disco ball encasing to be suspended from a hook.

Next, I employed an ESP-32 to not only control the motors but also establish a Wi-Fi connection between the ESP-32 and an Alexa device. By integrating these components, an impressive project is achieved.
