# Bluetooth Alexa Disco Ball

##### have you ever wanted to have a disco party on command? 

This simple project gives you opportunity to do that with two main components 
  1. ESP-32
  2. Amazon Alexa
 
 
This project ijs easy to follow and stright forward. I first started with creating a 3d model that I could encase the electrical components in (I also really wanted to jump into OnShape and get some 3d models done). The 3d model is very elementry with small features, but more features can always be added, like a mechanism that can make the disco ball encasing hang from a hook. I then use an ESP-32 to not only controll the motors but connect the ESP-32 to an Alexa throug wifi. Put this all together and you get a pretty impressive project!
